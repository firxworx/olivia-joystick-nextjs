## Summary to Date

Olivia loves the 'joystick toy'. When we first tried it, she was able to figure it out quickly. It took about 10 min for her to realize that this was something special and that _she_ was in direct control of what show was playing on the TV. She was literally paralyzed with excitement.

This is the first time in her life that she's been able to meaningfully interact with a piece of technology.

We have successfully demonstrated that Olivia operates at a cognitive level where she completely understands what she's doing and can knowingly and purposefully control a machine. She has learned the interface and remembers how it works.

In many respects, this project has already succeeded where a small army of professionals have failed.

It will be exciting to see where this leads.

We change up the shows (Youtube URL's) every time we give the device to her. I think she appreciates the novelty of new content as much as the ability to control something on her own. I think she's seen every episide on her usual roster of shows dozens and dozens of times.

With the initial excitement tempered, Olivia will now choose what to watch. She behaves a lot like a typical child: she'll watch something for a while, linger longer on her favourites, and then change the channel when she wants to see somethig new.

Olivia's dexterity and flexibility seems to be rapidly improving now that she has an incentive. The device is something that she _wants_ to keep interacting with and has every reason to get better at.

In many respects this is the first time in her life that she's had the need to learn basic lessons like "watch what you're doing" and develop a sense of where her hands are in space especially when she's looking elsewhere. I figure that it's really important that she gets this experience now while she's a child and still has a degree of neuroplasticity.

The hardware joystick was the right call to accommodate Olivia's extremely limited mobility.

Olivia can't meaningfully control a touch screen because she can only "smudge" or "smear" the screen - her hands and wrists trigger multiple touch points at once. Screens are too large for her limited range of motion, and it's too easy to trigger other features of a tablet (such as opening the settings).

Past attempts by professional educators and therapists to get her to use assistive technologies such as eye-gaze/eye-tracking tools have all failed.

Extremely basic assistive devices like big buttons that play a word or sound when pressed never proved engaging enough for Olivia, so nobody could determine if she actually understood what their purpose was.

I think Olivia has started interacting with her iPad differently now that she has more experience with the joystick device. She is almost always accompanied by one. It's eternally playing episodes of her favourite shows to help keep her stimulated. Previously it seemed that she'd only interact with it to watch the UI respond or to seek the attention of a caregiver if she managed to knock it over or haphazardly stop whatever she was watching from playing. I may be wrong on this one, but it strikes me that it has "clicked" with her that this is a device that she could potentially control too if only she could only wrangle her hands to produce a lone finger.

The code is updated so altButton will now change the mode vs joystick left/right. Olivia would accidentally hit left/right when trying to navigate TelevisionMode channels up/down and it'd frustrate her when the mode changed.

The other big reason for adding a new button is to free up the entire joystick and a button to enable basic games. Refer to the 3D branch. I have limited experience with 3D and essentially none with webGL so this will be fun.

I figure if she can get into basic games, we'll be able to test her abilities further and open the door to even more rapid improvements in her dexterity and control. They will open the door to more advanced UI's and worlds of new possibilities. In a dream scenario they could perhaps even lead to the ability to control a wheelchair or command an assistive robot. It'd be a game changer for her mother if she could keep herself occupied for lengthy periods of time like other kids her age often do with video games.

Olivia got to try the new button this evening and she seems to get it.

The buttons were mounted too low so she would accidentally press them when resting her hands. Frustrations aside, I think it proved to be a good coaching opportunity: if she inadvertently paused the TV (main red button) or changed the mode (new blue button) then it was up to her to change it back. She needed help but I think she's on the right track. I think the big change coupled with accidental button presses confused her at times. I'm confident that she'll only advance from here.

Olivia's mother helped re-jig the controller to move the buttons to the higher of the two available rows in the box.

Add a new button to the rig, will name it 'altButton' for now.

Olivia's improving dexterity gives confidence that she will be able to use the new input.
